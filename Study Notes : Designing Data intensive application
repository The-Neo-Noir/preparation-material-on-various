CHAPTER 1
Reliable, Scalable, and
Maintainable Applications
	Many applications today are data-intensive, as opposed to compute-intensive.

	Although a database and a message queue have some superficial similarity—
both store data for some time—they have very different access patterns, which means
different performance characteristics, and thus very different implementations.

there are datastores that are also used as message
queues (Redis), and there are message queues with database-like durability guarantees
(Apache Kafka). The boundaries between the categories are becoming blurred

Reliability : 
	The systems that anticipate faults and
can cope with them are called fault-tolerant or resilient.
