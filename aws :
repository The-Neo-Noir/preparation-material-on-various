	> history : 
		> 2003, 2004 lunched with sqs
		> 2017 AI and virtual reality
		> More than 1300+ servcies 
		> AWS is in the leader , microsoft azure is close by 

	> High level view 
		> 22 regions : Region is geographical areas where the aws presence is 
		> 61 availablity zone : aZ is how many data centers they have in each region, typically more than 2 for redundancy
		Edge locations are for caching contents typically CDN and cloudfront , more edge locations than regions

 	> individual objects don't inherit the buckets tags
 	> Client side encryption and service side encryption , only at the rest 
 	> Bucket acl or bucket policy 

 Versioning: 
 	> Once versioning is enabled , you can't disable it , only suspend it.
 	> Large files once versioned will keep the same file as many vresion times
 	> Protect people from accidentally deleting
 		> USe MFA 
 Cross region replication: 
 	> YOu can replicate a bucket in another region, remember versioning is required.
 	> The existing objects will not be replicated, only the new ones will be
